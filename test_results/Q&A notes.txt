Put your experience in your CV

Put at the top of the CV who you are i.e software developer

2 page cv is fine

#Prepare for who you want to apply

Define who you want to work for
after that make a list of 10 companies
	who they are
	I've seen what you've done and this is what I could do for you

Ask questions before applying
	i.e what kind of C jobs you got
	are there any objective C things
	do you have anything to deal with natural language processes
	what about mobile?
	what should I focus on

What do you expect me to accomplish in X amount of time
What should I be able to do in 2 months time
give them space to answer
be interested in what the person says if she says anything personal

#Define your value
	Externel value
	Internal value

3000 euros is good for a JUNIOR
2500 is good for an INTERN
if your don't have the budget then we can talk about it when you got the budget
	if they say a low offer then ask how are you able to do that

As an intern you will have a buddy assigned

If you don't like your buddy don't be afraid to ask for a new buddy

Always under promise and over deliver
